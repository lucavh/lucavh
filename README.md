Hi! I‚Äôm Luca Verhees, a creative data scientist/engineer with a multidisciplinary skill set who gets excited about applied machine learning and demand forecasting in particular.

üë©‚Äçüíª &nbsp;&nbsp;Through my work, I create meaningful impact by solving business challenges with end-to-end data science products and taking business partners along on that journey. Currently, I'm working as a Data Scientist at [Nederlandse Spoorwegen](https://www.werkenbijns.nl/onze-verhalen/kickstart-ai), the principal passenger railway operator in the Netherlands.

üå± &nbsp;&nbsp;I‚Äôm currently expanding my knowledge on [Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming](https://dataorigami.net/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/). I recently completed a linear algebra course based on [the book](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/) and [lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/video_galleries/video-lectures/) by the amazing [Gilbert Strang](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/).

üí´ &nbsp;&nbsp;I have an entrepreneurial spirit, started freelancing as a 17 y/o. Over the years, I have developed a versatile skill set and gained experience across different roles and industries, both technical and business-oriented. I'm fascinated by the way people interact with technology and strive to make those interactions more intuitive and meaningful.

üí¨ &nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me about MLops, time series forecasting, design and UX.

‚öíÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the tools & technologies I work with on a day-to-day basis:
