Hello! I‚Äôm Luca ‚Äì a data enthusiast, crafting clarity and innovation through code and creativity.

üë©‚Äçüíª &nbsp;&nbsp;Through my work, I create meaningful impact by solving business challenges ‚Äãwith end-to-end data science products. Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at [Nederlandse Spoorwegen](https://www.ns.nl/), the principal passenger railway operator in the Netherlands. I‚Äôm also a proud Ambassador for [Kickstart AI](https://www.kickstartai.org/), contributing to their mission of making the future of AI orange.

üå± &nbsp;&nbsp;I‚Äôm currently expanding my knowledge on [Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming](https://dataorigami.net/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/). Furthermore, inspired by the [art of analog data visualisation](https://www.dear-data.com/theproject) and my love for knitting, I'm knitting my daily step counts into a blanket.

üí´ &nbsp;&nbsp;I have an academic background in Data Science and Applied Machine Learning. From a young age, my entrepreneurial spirit led me on a freelance journey, catalyzing my development into a multifaceted professional. I'm fascinated by the way people interact with technology and strive to make those interactions more intuitive and meaningful. As a natural chameleon, I effortlessly switch perspectives and I translate data complexity into narratives that resonate with people.

üí¨ &nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me about demand forecasting, data storytelling, and data science for strategic decision making.

‚öíÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the tools & technologies I work with on a day-to-day basis:
